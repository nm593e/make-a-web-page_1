          Photography is a broad subject that eventually boils down to a mixture of art and science. Now, before we disappear down the 
          <em>"Is photography an art?"</em> road I said it was a mixture and although the process of taking and processing a photograph is down to physics and chemistry the driving force behind it is often to some degree artistic or at least creative.

          <u>How to take a picture.</u> <br>
          <b>Compose and expose.</b> <br>
          You compose first and expose second that is the rule. <br><br>
          We will discuss more in detail as we move on to other Chapters.

        <p> There are 3 basic ways to arrange the elements within your composition. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Physically move objects relative to each other. Only really works with still life photography. </li>
            <li>Tell people to move relative to each other or other objects. Only works with people who can hear you.</li>
            <li>Move ! Usually the most effective way to control your composition is to alter your viewpoint.</li>

          <b>The Rule of Thirds </b>suggests that an image should be composed as if divided into nine equal parts by two equally-spaced horizontal lines and two equally-spaced vertical lines with important elements of interest placed on or close to these lines or their points of intersection. 
        </p>

          The brand of the camera comes into some concern when considering lens and accessory compatibility. At the end of the day, you're looking to buy a camera, not a brand. Ultimately, every camera has the ability to take good photos. Some cameras just make it easier to take good photos than others. Whatever camera you decide to go with, if you think it's a great camera then it will be for you.
